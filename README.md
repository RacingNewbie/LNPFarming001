# Crop Production and Management ðŸŒ¾

This project aims to recommend the **most suitable crop** to grow based on **soil nutrients** and environmental conditions such as **temperature, humidity, and pH**. By leveraging machine learning, this system helps farmers optimize crop yield and make data-driven agricultural decisions.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Selecting the right crop for a given land plot is crucial for maximizing yield and reducing resource wastage. This project analyzes key soil properties and environmental factors to predict the **optimal crop** for cultivation.

The goal is to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection while considering sustainability and productivity.
