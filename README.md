## ðŸš€ Project Overview

Selecting the right crop for a given land plot is crucial for maximizing yield and reducing resource wastage. This project analyzes key soil properties and environmental factors to predict the **optimal crop** for cultivation.

The goal is to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection while considering sustainability and productivity.
